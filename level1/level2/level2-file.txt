Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything. That's my family Kay, that's not me. Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. You can act like a man!

What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! It's an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men. It's not personal. It's business. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you.
