I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart! You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns. Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child.


Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you. It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. Do me this favor. I won't forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor.
