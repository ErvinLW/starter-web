I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. I don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English. If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone. We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family. I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman; blood is a big expense.
