I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. I don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English. If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone. We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family. I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman; blood is a big expense.



Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. What's the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he's born? Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind. What's wrong with being a lawyer? It's an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men. The hotel, the casino. The Corleone Family wants to buy you out.



Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? I see you took the name of the town. What was your father's name? I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father.

I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see. They talk when they should listen.
