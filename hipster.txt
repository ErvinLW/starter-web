I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. I don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English. If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone. We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family.

Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. What's the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he's born?

Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men. The hotel, the casino. The Corleone Family wants to buy you out.
